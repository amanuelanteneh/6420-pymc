abstract = {SUMMARY This paper describes a method for choosing a natural conjugate prior distribution for a normal linear sampling model. A person using the method to quantify his/her opinions performs specified elicitation tasks. The hyperparameters of the conjugate distribution are estimated from the elicited values. The method is designed to require elicitation tasks that people can perform competently and introduces a type of task not previously reported. A property of the method is that the assessed variance matrices are certain to be positive definite. The method is sufficiently simple to implement with an interactive computer program on a microcomputer.},

 abstract = {Statistical issues in conducting randomized trials include the choice of a sample size, whether to stop a trial early and the appropriate analysis and interpretation of the trial results. At each of these stages, evidence external to the trial is useful, but generally such evidence is introduced in an unstructured and informal manner. We argue that a Bayesian approach allows a formal basis for using external evidence and in addition provides a rational way for dealing with issues such as the ethics of randomization, trials to show treatment equivalence, the monitoring of accumulating data and the prediction of the consequences of continuing a study. The motivation for using this methodology is practical rather than ideological.},
